In addition to deleting by the model type (or `Predicates.ALL`), a record with a custom primary key can be deleted the following ways:

With the value of the primary key:
```graphql
const todo = await DataStore.delete(Todo, '12345');
```

With a predicate:
```graphql
const todo = await DataStore.delete(Todo, t =>
    t.customId('eq', '12345')
);
```

With a predicate containing the primary key and sort key:
```graphql
const todo = await DataStore.delete(Todo, t =>
    t.customId('eq', '12345').title('eq', 'My Todo')
);
```

With an object literal:
```graphql
const todo = await DataStore.delete(Todo, { 
    customId: '12345' 
});
```

With an object literal containing the primary key and sort key:
```graphql
    const todo = await DataStore.delete(Todo, {
        customId: '12345',
        title: 'My Todo',
    });
```
